i3-wm (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In addition to the proper flex/bison based parser for the config file
    introduced in 3.δ, we now also have a flex/bison parser for commands. What
    this means is that we can have more human-readable, beautiful command names
    instead of cryptic commands like 'f' for fullscreen or 'mh' for move left.
    In fact, the commands for the aforementioned functions *are* 'fullscreen'
    and 'move left'!
  * You can now chain commands using ';' (a semicolon). One example for that is
    'workspace 3 ; exec /usr/bin/urxvt' to switch to a new workspace and open a
    terminal.
  * You can specify which windows should be affected by your command by using
    different criteria. A good example is '[class="Firefox"] kill' to get rid
    of all Firefox windows.
  * As the configuration file needs new commands (and a few options are
    obsolete), you need to change it. To make this process a little bit easier
    for you, this release comes with the script i3-migrate-config-to-v4. Just
    run it on your current config file and it will spit out a v4 config file to
    stdout. To make things even better, i3 automatically detects v3 config files
    and calls that script, so you never end up with a non-working config :).
  * Similarly to the criteria when using commands, we now have a 'for_window'
    configuration directive, which lets you automatically apply certain commands
    to certain windows. Use it to set border styles per window, for example with
    'for_window [class="XTerm"] border 1pixel'.
  * Since dock clients (like dzen2) are now part of the layout tree (as opposed
    to a custom data structure as before), it was easy to implement top and
    bottom dock areas. Programs which properly specify the dock hint get placed
    on the edge of the screen they request. i3bar has the -dtop and -dbottom
    parameters, for example.
  * The internal workspace bar is obsolete. Use i3bar instead.
  * Resizing now works between all windows!
  * Fullscreen now works for everything!
  * Floating now works for everything!
  * Your layout is now preserved when doing an inplace restart.
  * When you have an error in your config file, a new program called i3-nagbar
    will tell you so. It offers you two buttons: One to view the error in your
    $PAGER and one to edit your config in your $EDITOR.
  * The default config used key symbols (like 'bind Mod1+f fullscreen') instead
    of key codes. If you use a non-qwerty layout, the program i3-config-wizard
    can create a key symbol based config file based on your current layout. You
    can also chose between Windows (Mod4) and Alt (Mod1) as your default
    modifier. i3-config-wizard will automatically be started as long as you
    don’t have a configuration file for i3.
  * Custom X cursor themes are now supported.
  * The RandR backend now respects the primary output.
  * A wrong 'font' configuration in your config file will no longer make i3
    exit. Instead, it will fall back to a different font and tell you about the
    error in its log.
  * The default split direction (whether a new window gets placed right next to
    the current one or below the current one) is now automatically set to
    horizontal if you have a monitor that is wider than high or vertical if you
    a monitor which is higher than wide. This works great with rotated monitors.
  * Sockets and temporary files are now placed in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, if set (this
    is used on systemd based systems).
  * Tools like i3bar, i3-msg etc. use the I3_SOCKET_PATH property which is set
    to the X11 root window, so you don’t have to configure your socket path
    anywhere.
  * The kill command kills single windows by default now. To kill a whole
    application, use 'kill client'.
  * IPC: Commands can now have custom replies. When the parser encounters an
    error, a proper error reply is sent.
  * There is now an 'exec_always' configuration directive which works like
    'exec' but will also be run when restarting.

  * Bugfix: When entering a stack window with the mouse, set focus to the
    active client in the container the stack window belongs to.

  * Bugfix: Correctly remove client from container when moving to another
    workspace.
  * Bugfix: Set focus to the client which was previously focused instead of

    previously were in a column/row which is not available on the destination
    screen.

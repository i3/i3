i3-wm (3.a-bf1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: When entering a stack window with the mouse, set focus to the
    active client in the container the stack window belongs to.
  * Bugfix: Correctly filter out the numlock bit. This fixes i3 not reacting
    to any keybindings after pressing numlock once.
  * Bugfix: Don't crash when Xinerama is disabled.
  * Bugfix: Correctly remove client from container when moving to another
    workspace.
  * Bugfix: Set focus to the client which was previously focused instead of
    the next client in container when moving windows out of a container.
  * Bugfix: Correctly set focus when switching between screens.
  * Bugfix: Don't crash anymore moving focus to another screen under the
    following conditions: The screen you switch to has a lower number of cells
    and/or rows than the current one, you switch focus using your mouse, you
    previously were in a column/row which is not available on the destination
    screen.
  * Bugfix: When switching screens, warp the pointer to the correct
    destination window.
  * Bugfix: Store dock clients per screen, not per workspace.
  * Bugfix: Perform bounds checking for snapped containers.
  * Bugfix: Send clients their absolute position/size (on the root window) in
    generated configure events. This fixes problems with xfontsel, xmaple,
    etc.
  * Bugfix: Correctly update state when moving fullscreen windows across
    workspaces.
  * Implement scrolling on stack windows and on the bottom bar.
  * Create i3-wm-dbg with debug symbols
  * Don't rely on libxcb-wm any longer, as it got removed in libxcb 0.3.4.

 │ Release notes for i3 v4.20   │
 └──────────────────────────────┘

This is i3 v4.19. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Background/wallpaper workaround:

Some login managers (e.g. gdm) start the X11 server with the -background none
flag. When this flag is set, a background needs to be explicitly set later in
the X11 session, otherwise stale copies of closed windows remain visible on the
X11 root window (symptom looks like “my terminal window is not closing”).

i3 works around this situation by setting a screenshot as background when
starting. Any background you set before starting i3 (e.g. in your Xsession) or
after starting i3 (e.g. via exec statements in the i3 config) will be visible.

A downside of this workaround is that if you have any windows already open in
your X11 session, those will be part of the screenshot.

To fix this issue, starting in v4.20, i3 detects whether the -background none
option is enabled and only then sets a screenshot as background.

  • default config: use dex for XDG autostart
  • i3-nagbar: position on focused monitor by default
  • i3-nagbar: add option to position on primary monitor
  • alternate focusing tab/stack children-parent containers by clicking on their titlebars
  • i3bar: use first bar config by default
  • i3-dump-log -f now uses UNIX sockets instead of pthreads. The UNIX socket approach
    should be more reliable and also more portable.
  • Allow for_window to match against WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
  • Add %machine placeholder (WM_CLIENT_MACHINE) to title_format
  • Allow multiple output names in 'move container|workspace to output'
  • Add 'move container|workspace to output next'

  • Add --replace command line argument to replace an existing WM

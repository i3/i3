<h1>i3lock — improved screen locker</h1>

<p>
  i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will see
  a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return to your
  screen by entering your password.
</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM (run
    "i3lock &amp;&amp; echo mem &gt; /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
    after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)
  </li>
  <li>
    You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
    displayed while your screen is locked.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.
  </li>
  <li>
    i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
  </li>
</ul>

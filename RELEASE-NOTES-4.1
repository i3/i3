 │ Release notes for i3 v4.1  │
 └────────────────────────────┘

This is the second release of the new major version of i3, v4.1. It brings some
new (and long-awaited) features, the most prominent being tray support in i3bar
(for NetworkManager, Skype, etc.). 

The assign syntax has changed to support criteria now. Also, criteria support
regular expressions (using PCRE) now. Check the userguide for the new syntax.
i3-nagbar will automatically display a warning when you use the old syntax.

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don’t support
startup notifications. If the cursor change bothers you, turn it off by using
the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

This release has been in use by many users and is considered stable. Please
upgrade.

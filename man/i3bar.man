== NAME

i3bar - xcb-based status- and workspace-bar

== SYNOPSIS

*i3bar* [*-b* 'bar_id'] [*-s* 'sock_path'] [*-t*] [*-h*] [*-v*] [*-V*]

== WARNING

i3bar will automatically be invoked by i3 for every 'bar' configuration block.

Starting it manually is usually not what you want to do.

You have been warned!

== OPTIONS

*-s, --socket* 'sock_path'::
Overwrites the path to the i3 IPC socket.

*-b, --bar_id* 'bar_id'::
Specifies the bar ID for which to get the configuration from i3. By default,
i3bar will use the first bar block as configured in i3.

*-t, --transparency*::
Enable transparency (RGBA colors)

*-h, --help*::
Display a short help-message and exit

*-v, --version*::
Display version number and exit.

*-V*::
Be verbose.

== DESCRIPTION

*i3bar* displays a bar at the bottom (or top) of your monitor(s) containing
workspace switching buttons and a statusline generated by i3status(1) or
similar. It is automatically invoked (and configured through) i3.

i3bar supports colors via a JSON protocol starting from v4.2, see
https://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html

== ENVIRONMENT

=== I3SOCK

Used as a fallback for the i3 IPC socket path if neither the commandline
contains an argument nor the I3_SOCKET_PATH property is set on the X11 root
window.

== EXAMPLES

Nothing to see here, move along. As stated above, you should not run i3bar manually.

Instead, see the i3 documentation, especially the Userâ€™s Guide.

== SEE ALSO

+i3status(1)+, +j4status(1)+ or +conky(1)+ for programs generating a statusline.

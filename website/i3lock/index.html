<h1>i3lock — a slightly improved version of slock</h1>

<p>
  i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
  commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off
  your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays a
  white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from suspend
  or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong password,
  i3lock does not call XBell(). This is important because i3lock/slock think
  you’ve entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, i3lock supports PAM since version 1.0 (that is, LDAP users
  can use i3lock now, too).

== NAME

i3-sensible-terminal - launches $TERMINAL with fallbacks

== SYNOPSIS

i3-sensible-terminal [arguments]

== DESCRIPTION

i3-sensible-terminal is invoked in the i3 default config to start a terminal.
This wrapper script is necessary since there is no distribution-independent
terminal launcher (but for example Debian has x-terminal-emulator).
Distribution packagers are responsible for shipping this script in a way which
is appropriate for the distribution.

It tries to start one of the following (in that order):

* $TERMINAL (this is a non-standard variable)
* x-terminal-emulator (only present on Debian and derivatives)
* mate-terminal
* gnome-terminal
* terminator
* xfce4-terminal
* urxvt
* rxvt
* termit
* Eterm
* aterm
* uxterm
* xterm
* roxterm
* termite
* lxterminal
* terminology
* st
* qterminal
* lilyterm
* tilix
* terminix
* konsole
* kitty
* guake
* tilda
* alacritty
* hyper

Please donâ€™t complain about the order: If the user has any preference, they will
have $TERMINAL set or modified their i3 configuration file.

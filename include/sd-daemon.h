/*
  Reference implementation of a few systemd related interfaces for
  writing daemons. These interfaces are trivial to implement. To
  simplify porting we provide this reference implementation.
  Applications are welcome to reimplement the algorithms described
  here if they do not want to include these two source files.

  The following functionality is provided:

  - Support for logging with log levels on stderr
  - File descriptor passing for socket-based activation
  - Daemon startup and status notification
  - Detection of systemd boots

  You may compile this with -DDISABLE_SYSTEMD to disable systemd
  support. This makes all those calls NOPs that are directly related to
  systemd (i.e. only sd_is_xxx() will stay useful).

  Since this is drop-in code we don't want any of our symbols to be
  exported in any case. Hence we declare hidden visibility for all of
  them.

  You may find an up-to-date version of these source files online:

  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/plain/src/sd-daemon.h
  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/plain/src/sd-daemon.c

  This should compile on non-Linux systems, too, but with the
  exception of the sd_is_xxx() calls all functions will become NOPs.

  See sd-daemon(7) for more information.

/*
  Informs systemd about changed daemon state. This takes a number of
  newline separated environment-style variable assignments in a
  string. The following variables are known:

     READY=1      Tells systemd that daemon startup is finished (only
                  relevant for services of Type=notify). The passed
                  argument is a boolean "1" or "0". Since there is
                  little value in signaling non-readiness the only
                  value daemons should send is "READY=1".

     STATUS=...   Passes a single-line status string back to systemd
                  that describes the daemon state. This is free-from
                  and can be used for various purposes: general state
                  feedback, fsck-like programs could pass completion
                  percentages and failing programs could pass a human
                  readable error message. Example: "STATUS=Completed
                  66% of file system check..."

     ERRNO=...    If a daemon fails, the errno-style error code,
                  formatted as string. Example: "ERRNO=2" for ENOENT.

     BUSERROR=... If a daemon fails, the D-Bus error-style error
                  code. Example: "BUSERROR=org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut"

     MAINPID=...  The main pid of a daemon, in case systemd did not
                  fork off the process itself. Example: "MAINPID=4711"

  Daemons can choose to send additional variables. However, it is
  recommended to prefix variable names not listed above with X_.

  Returns a negative errno-style error code on failure. Returns > 0
  if systemd could be notified, 0 if it couldn't possibly because
  systemd is not running.

  Example: When a daemon finished starting up, it could issue this
  call to notify systemd about it:

     sd_notify(0, "READY=1");

  See sd_notifyf() for more complete examples.

  See sd_notify(3) for more information.
*/
int sd_notify(int unset_environment, const char *state) _sd_hidden_;

  Similar to sd_notify() but takes a format string.

  Example 1: A daemon could send the following after initialization:

                   "STATUS=Processing requests...\n"
                   "MAINPID=%lu",
                   (unsigned long) getpid());

  Example 2: A daemon could send the following shortly before
  exiting, on failure:

     sd_notifyf(0, "STATUS=Failed to start up: %s\n"
                   "ERRNO=%i",
                   strerror(errno),

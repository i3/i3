#
# Starts i3 using socket activation. Creates a listening socket (with bind +
# listen) which is then passed to i3, who in turn calls accept and handles the
# requests.
#
# Since the kernel buffers the connect, the parent process can connect to the
# socket immediately after forking. It then sends a request and waits until it
# gets an answer. Obviously, i3 has to be initialized to actually answer the
# request.
#
# This way, we can wait *precisely* the amount of time which i3 waits to get
# ready, which is a *HUGE* speed gain (and a lot more robust) in comparison to
# using sleep() with a fixed amount of time.

  * Bugfix: When entering a stack window with the mouse, set focus to the
    active client in the container the stack window belongs to.
  * Bugfix: Correctly filter out the numlock bit. This fixes i3 not reacting
    to any keybindings after pressing numlock once.
  * Bugfix: Don't crash when Xinerama is disabled.
  * Bugfix: Correctly remove client from container when moving to another
    workspace.
  * Bugfix: Set focus to the client which was previously focused instead of
    the next client in container when moving windows out of a container.
  * Bugfix: Correctly set focus when switching between screens.
  * Bugfix: Don't crash anymore moving focus to another screen under the
    following conditions: The screen you switch to has a lower number of cells
    and/or rows than the current one, you switch focus using your mouse, you
    previously were in a column/row which is not available on the destination
    screen.
  * Bugfix: When switching screens, warp the pointer to the correct
    destination window.
  * Bugfix: Store dock clients per screen, not per workspace.
  * Bugfix: Perform bounds checking for snapped containers.

    workspaces.
  * Bugfix: Correctly restart i3 when not using its absolute path
  * Bugfix: Drag & Drop in GTK applications works now

    when raising clients in stacked containers.

  * Bugfix: Re-distribute free space when closing customly resized containers,
    re-evaluate for other containers
  * Bugfix: When moving windows into different containers, insert them at the
    correct position.

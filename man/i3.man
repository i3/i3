== NAME

i3 - an improved dynamic, tiling window manager

== SYNOPSIS

i3 [-a] [-c configfile] [-C] [-d all] [-v] [-V]

== OPTIONS

-a::
Disables autostart.

-c::
Specifies an alternate configuration file path.

-C::
Check the configuration file for validity and exit.

-d all::
Enables debug logging.
The 'all' parameter is present for historical reasons.

-v::
Display version number (and date of the last commit).

-V::
Be verbose.

--force-xinerama::
Use Xinerama instead of RandR. This option should only be used if you are stuck
with the old nVidia closed source driver (older than 302.17) which does not
support RandR.

--get-socketpath::
Retrieve the i3 IPC socket path from X11, print it, then exit.

--shmlog-size <limit>::
Limits the size of the i3 SHM log to <limit> bytes. Setting this to 0 disables
SHM logging entirely. The default is 0 bytes.

== DESCRIPTION

=== INTRODUCTION

i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time, didn’t
provide some features we wanted (multi-monitor done right, for example), had
some bugs, didn’t progress since quite some time and wasn’t easy to hack at all
(source code comments/documentation completely lacking). Still, we think the
wmii developers and contributors did a great job. Thank you for inspiring us to
create i3.

Please be aware that i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.

=== IMPORTANT NOTE TO nVidia BINARY DRIVER USERS

If you are using the nVidia binary graphics driver (also known as 'blob')
before version 302.17, you need to use the +--force-xinerama+ flag (in your
~/.xsession) when starting i3, like so:

----------------------------------------------
exec i3 --force-xinerama -V >>~/.i3/i3log 2>&1
----------------------------------------------

See also docs/multi-monitor for the full explanation.

=== TERMINOLOGY

Tree::
i3 keeps your layout in a tree data structure.

Window::
An X11 window, like the Firefox browser window or a terminal emulator.

Split container::
A split container contains multiple other split containers or windows.
+
Containers can be used in various layouts. The default mode is called "default"
and just resizes each client equally so that it fits.

Workspace::
A workspace is a set of containers. Other window managers call this "Virtual
Desktops".
+
In i3, each workspace is assigned to a specific virtual screen. By default,
screen 1 has workspace 1, screen 2 has workspace 2 and so on… However, when you
create a new workspace (by simply switching to it), it’ll be assigned the
screen you are currently on.

Output::
Using XRandR, you can have an X11 screen spanning multiple real monitors.
Furthermore, you can set them up in cloning mode or with positions (monitor 1
is left of monitor 2).
+
i3 uses the RandR API to query which outputs are available and which screens
are connected to these outputs.

== KEYBINDINGS

Here is a short overview of the default keybindings:

Mod1+Enter::
Open a new terminal emulator window.

Mod1+d::
Open dmenu for starting any application by typing (part of) its name.

j/k/l/;::
Direction keys (left, down, up, right). They are on your homerow (see the mark
on your "j" key). Alternatively, you can use the cursor keys.

Mod1+<direction>::
Focus window in <direction>.

Mod1+Shift+<direction>::
Move window to <direction>.

Mod1+<number>::
Switch to workspace <number>.

Mod1+Shift+<number>::
Move window to workspace <number>.

Mod1+f::
Toggle fullscreen mode.

Mod1+s::
Enable stacking layout for the current container.

Mod1+e::
Enable default layout for the current container.

Mod1+w::
Enable tabbed layout for the current container.

Mod1+Shift+Space::
Toggle tiling/floating for the current container.

Mod1+Space::
Select the first tiling container if the current container is floating and
vice-versa.

Mod1+Shift+q::
Kills the current window. This is equivalent to "clicking on the close button",
meaning a polite request to the application to close this window. For example,
Firefox will save its session upon such a request. If the application does not
support that, the window will be killed and it depends on the application what
happens.

Mod1+Shift+r::
Restarts i3 in place. Your layout will be preserved.

Mod1+Shift+e::
Exits i3.

== FILES

=== \~/.i3/config (or ~/.config/i3/config)

When starting, i3 looks for configuration files in the following order:

1. ~/.config/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config if set)
2. /etc/xdg/i3/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3/config if set)
3. ~/.i3/config
4. /etc/i3/config

You can specify a custom path using the -c option.

.Sample configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------
# i3 config file (v4)

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.
# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8
# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesn’t scale on retina/hidpi displays.

# use Mouse+Mod1 to drag floating windows to their wanted position
floating_modifier Mod1

# start a terminal
bindsym Mod1+Return exec /usr/bin/urxvt

# kill focused window
bindsym Mod1+Shift+q kill

bindsym Mod1+Right focus right

# move focused window
bindsym Mod1+Shift+j move left
bindsym Mod1+Shift+k move down

# ..

# move focused container to workspace

# reload the configuration file
bindsym Mod1+Shift+c reload
# restart i3 inplace (preserves your layout/session, can be used to upgrade i3)
bindsym Mod1+Shift+r restart
# exit i3 (logs you out of your X session)
bindsym Mod1+Shift+e exit

# display workspace buttons plus a statusline generated by i3status
bar {
    status_command i3status
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

=== ~/.xsession

This file is where you should configure your locales and start i3. It is run by
your login manager (xdm, slim, gdm, …) as soon as you login.

.Sample xsession
-------------------------------------------------------------
# Disable DPMS turning off the screen
xset -dpms
xset s off

# Disable bell
xset -b

# Enable zapping (C-A-<Bksp> kills X)
setxkbmap -option terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp

# Enforce correct locales from the beginning:
# LC_ALL is unset since it overwrites everything
# LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 is used, except for:
# LC_MESSAGES=C never translates program output
# LC_TIME=en_DK leads to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm date/time output
unset LC_ALL
export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
export LC_MESSAGES=C
export LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8

# Use XToolkit in java applications
export AWT_TOOLKIT=XToolkit

# Set background color
xsetroot -solid "#333333"

# Enable core dumps in case something goes wrong
ulimit -c unlimited

# Start i3 and log to ~/.i3/logfile
echo "Starting at $(date)" >> ~/.i3/logfile
exec /usr/bin/i3 -V -d all >> ~/.i3/logfile
-------------------------------------------------------------

== ENVIRONMENT

=== I3SOCK

This variable overwrites the IPC socket path (placed in
/tmp/i3-%u.XXXXXX/ipc-socket.%p by default, where %u is replaced with your UNIX
username, %p is replaced with i3’s PID and XXXXXX is a string of random
characters from the portable filename character set (see mkdtemp(3))). The IPC
socket is used by external programs like i3-msg(1) or i3bar(1).

== TODO

There is still lot of work to do. Please check our bugtracker for up-to-date
information about tasks which are still not finished.

== SEE ALSO

You should have a copy of the userguide (featuring nice screenshots/graphics
which is why this is not integrated into this manpage), the debugging guide,
and the "how to hack" guide. If you are building from source, run:
 +make -C docs+

 │ Release notes for i3 v4.19   │
 └──────────────────────────────┘

This is i3 v4.19. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

In this release, we switched from the autotools build system to the meson build
system (https://mesonbuild.com/). Check https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/4086 for
details. If this causes problems for you, you can revert the commit which
removed autotools from the tree: we tried our best to keep both build systems
working. Please reach out to us in that case!

  • configure: respect --program-suffix
  • use exec to avoid leaving useless shell process
  • ipc: always include the marks property (even if empty)
  • ipc: introduce GET_BINDING_STATE command
  • introduce “tiling_from” and ”floating_from” criteria
  • make dock client order deterministic (sorted by class/instance) as a
    side effect, i3bars without an explicit bar-id will be sorted according
    to their definition order in the config file
  • update i3bar config when necessary (reduces redraws on bar mode changes)
  • mention rofi in default config file

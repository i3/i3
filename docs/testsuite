i3 testsuite
============

September 2011

This document explains how the i3 testsuite works, how to use it and how to
extend it. It is targeted at developers who not necessarily have been doing
testing before or have not been testing in Perl before. In general, the
testsuite is not of interest for end users.


== Introduction

The i3 testsuite is a collection of files which contain testcases for various
i3 features. Some of them test if a certain workflow works correctly (moving
windows, focus behaviour, …). Others are regression tests and contain code
which previously made i3 crash or lead to unexpected behaviour. They then check
if i3 still runs (meaning it did not crash) and if it handled everything
correctly.

The goal of having these tests is to automatically find problems and to
automatically get a feel for whether a change in the source code breaks any
existing feature. After every modification of the i3 sourcecode, the developer
should run the full testsuite. If one of the tests does not pass (but fails),
the corresponding problem should be fixed (or, in some cases, the testcase has
to be modified). For every bugreport, a testcase should be written to test the
correct behaviour. Initially, it will fail, but after fixing the bug, it will
pass. This ensures (or increases the chance) that bugs which have been fixed
once will never be found again.

Also, when implementing a new feature, a testcase might be a good way to be
able to easily test if the feature is working correctly. Many developers will
test manually if everything works. Having a testcase not only helps you with
that, but it will also be useful for every future change.

== Implementation

For several reasons, the i3 testsuite has been implemented in Perl:

1. Perl has a long tradition of testing. Every popular/bigger Perl module which
   you can find on CPAN will not only come with documentation, but also with
   tests. Therefore, the available infrastructure for tests is comprehensive.
   See for example the excellent http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More
   and the referenced http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Tutorial.

2. Perl is widely available and has a well-working package infrastructure.
3. The author is familiar with Perl :).

Please do not start programming language flamewars at this point.

=== Mechanisms

==== Script: complete-run

The testcases are run by a script called +complete-run.pl+. It runs all
testcases by default, but you can be more specific and let it only run one or
more testcases. Also, it takes care of starting up a separate instance of i3
with an appropriate configuration file and creates a folder for each run
containing the appropriate i3 logfile for each testcase.  The latest folder can
always be found under the symlink +latest/+. It is recommended that you run the
tests on one or more separate X server instances (you can only start one window
manager per X session), for example using the provided Xdummy script.
+complete-run.pl+ takes one or more X11 display specifications and parallelizes
the testcases appropriately:

.Example invocation of complete-run.pl+
---------------------------------------
$ cd ~/i3/testcases

# start two dummy X11 instances in the background
$ ./Xdummy :1 &
$ ./Xdummy :2 &

$ ./complete-run.pl -d :1,:2
# output omitted because it is very long
All tests successful.

$ less latest/i3-log-for-04-floating.t
----------------------------------------

==== IPC interface

The testsuite makes extensive use of the IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
interface which i3 provides. It is used for the startup process of i3, for
terminating it cleanly and (most importantly) for modifying and getting the
current state (layout tree).

See [http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html] for documentation on the IPC interface.

==== X11::XCB

In order to open new windows, change attributes, get events, etc., the
testsuite uses X11::XCB, a new (and quite specific to i3 at the moment) Perl
module which uses the XCB protocol description to generate Perl bindings to
X11. They work in a very similar way to libxcb (which i3 uses) and provide
relatively high-level interfaces (objects such as +X11::XCB::Window+) aswell as
access to the low-level interface, which is very useful when testing a window
manager.

=== Filesystem structure

In the git root of i3, the testcases live in the folder +testcases+. This
folder contains the +complete-run.pl+ and +Xdummy+ scripts and a base
configuration file which will be used for the tests. The different testcases
themselve can be found in the conventionally named subfolder +t+:

== Anatomy of a testcase

Learning by example is definitely a good strategy when you are wondering how to
write a testcase. Let's take +t/11-goto.t+ as an easy example and go through it
step by step:

.t/11-goto.t: Boilerplate
----------------------
#!perl
# vim:ts=4:sw=4:expandtab

use i3test;
use File::Temp;

my $x = X11::XCB::Connection->new;
-----------------------

This is what we call boilerplate. It exists at the top of every test file (to
some extent). The first line is the shebang, which specifies that this file is
a Perl script. The second line contains VIM specific settings on how to
edit/format this file (use spaces instead of tabs, indent using 4 spaces).
Afterwards, the +i3test+ module is used. This module contains i3 testsuite
specific functions which you are strongly encouraged to use. They make writing
testcases a lot easier and will make it easier for other people to read your
tests.

The next line uses the +File::Temp+ module. This is specific to this testcase,
because it needs to generate a temporary name during the test. Many testcases
use only the +i3test+ module.

The last line opens a connection to X11. You might or might not need this in
your testcase, depending on whether you are going to open windows (etc.) or
only use i3 commands.

.t/11-goto.t: Setup
----------------------
my $tmp = fresh_workspace;

cmd 'split h';
----------------------

The first line calls i3test's +fresh_workspace+ function which looks for a
currently unused workspace, switches to it, and returns its name. The variable
+$tmp+ will end up having a value such as +"/tmp/87kBVcHbA9"+. Note that this
is not (necessarily) a valid path, it's just a random workspace name.

So, now that we are on a new workspace, we ensure that the workspace uses
horizontal orientation by issuing the +split h+ command (see the i3 User's
Guide for a list of commands). This is not strictly necessary, but good style.
In general, the +cmd+ function executes the specified i3 command by using the
IPC interface and returns once i3 acknowledged the command.

.t/11-goto.t: Setup
----------------------
#####################################################################
# Create two windows and make sure focus switching works
#####################################################################

my $top = open_window($x);
my $mid = open_window($x);
my $bottom = open_window($x);
----------------------

In every major section of a testcase, you should put a comment like the one
above. This makes it immediately clear how the file is structured.

The +open_window+ function opens a standard window, which will then be put into
tiling mode by i3. If you want a floating window, use the
+open_floating_window+ function. These functions accept the same parameters as
+X11::XCB::Window->new+, see the i3test documentation at TODO.

.t/11-goto.t: Helper function
----------------------
#
# Returns the input focus after sending the given command to i3 via IPC
# end sleeping for half a second to make sure i3 reacted
#
sub focus_after {
    my $msg = shift;

    cmd $msg;
    sync_with_i3 $x;
    return $x->input_focus;
}
----------------------

This section defines a helper function which will be used over and over in this
testcase. If you have code which gets executed more than once or twice
(depending on the length of your test, use your best judgement), please put it
in a function. Tests should be short, concise and clear.

The +focus_after+ function executes a command and returns the X11 focus after
the command was executed. The +sync_with_i3+ command makes sure that i3 could
push its state to X11. See <<i3_sync>> to learn how this works exactly.

.t/11-goto.t: Test assumptions
----------------------
$focus = $x->input_focus;
is($focus, $bottom->id, "Latest window focused");

$focus = focus_after('focus left');
is($focus, $mid->id, "Middle window focused");
----------------------

Now, we run the first two real tests. They use +Test::More+'s +is+ function,
which compares two values and prints the differences if they are not the same.
After the arguments, we supply a short comment to indicate what we are testing
here. This makes it vastly more easy for the developer to spot which testcase
is the problem in case one fails.

The first test checks that the most recently opened window is focused.
Afterwards, the command +focus left+ is issued and it is verified that the
middle window now has focus.

Note that this is not a comprehensive test of the +focus+ command -- we would
have to test wrapping, focus when using a more complex layout, focusing the
parent/child containers, etc. But that is not the point of this testcase.
Instead, we just want to know if +$x->input_focus+ corresponds with what we are
expecting. If not, something is completely wrong with the test environment and
this trivial test will fail.

.t/11-goto.t: Test that the feature does not work (yet)
----------------------
#####################################################################
# Now goto a mark which does not exist
#####################################################################

my $random_mark = mktemp('mark.XXXXXX');

$focus = focus_after(qq|[con_mark="$random_mark"] focus|);
is($focus, $mid->id, "focus unchanged");
----------------------

In this new major section, a random mark (mark is an identifier for a window,
see "VIM-like marks" in the i3 User’s Guide) will be generated. Afterwards, we
test that trying to focus that mark will not do anything. This is important: Do
not only test that using a feature has the expected outcome, but also test that
using it without properly initializing it does no harm. This command could for
example have changed focus anyways (a bug) or crash i3 (obviously a bug).

.t/11-goto.t: Test that the feature does work
----------------------
cmd "mark $random_mark";

$focus = focus_after('focus left');
is($focus, $top->id, "Top window focused");

$focus = focus_after(qq|[con_mark="$random_mark"] focus|);
is($focus, $mid->id, "goto worked");
----------------------

Remember: Focus was on the middle window (we verified that earlier in "Test
assumptions"). We now mark the middle window with our randomly generated mark.
Afterwards, we switch focus away from the middle window to be able to tell if
focusing it via its mark will work. If it does work (next test), the goto
command works.

.t/11-goto.t: Test corner case
----------------------
# check that we can specify multiple criteria

$focus = focus_after('focus left');
is($focus, $top->id, "Top window focused");

$focus = focus_after(qq|[con_mark="$random_mark" con_mark="$random_mark"] focus|);
is($focus, $mid->id, "goto worked");
----------------------

Now we test the same feature, but specifying the mark twice in the command.
This should have no effect, but let’s be sure: test it and see if things go
wrong.

.t/11-goto.t: Test second code path
----------------------
#####################################################################
# Check whether the focus command will switch to a different
# workspace if necessary
#####################################################################

my $tmp2 = fresh_workspace;

is(focused_ws(), $tmp2, 'tmp2 now focused');

cmd qq|[con_mark="$random_mark"] focus|;

is(focused_ws(), $tmp, 'tmp now focused');
----------------------

This part of the test checks that focusing windows by mark works across
workspaces. It uses i3test's +focused_ws+ function to get the current
workspace.

.t/11-goto.t: Test second code path
----------------------
done_testing;
----------------------

The end of every testcase has to contain the +done_testing+ line. This tells
+complete-run.pl+ that the test was finished successfully. If it does not
occur, the test might have crashed during execution -- some of the reasons why
that could happen are bugs in the used modules, bugs in the testcase itself or
an i3 crash resulting in the testcase being unable to communicate with i3 via
IPC anymore.

[[i3_sync]]
== Appendix A: The i3 sync protocol

Consider the following situation: You open two windows in your testcase, then
you use +focus left+ and want to verify that the X11 focus has been updated
properly. Sounds simple, right? Let’s assume you use this straight-forward
implementation:

.Racey focus testcase
-----------
my $left = open_window($x);
my $right = open_window($x);
cmd 'focus left';
is($x->input_focus, $left->id, 'left window focused');
----------

However, the test fails. Sometimes. Apparantly, there is a race condition in
your test. If you think about it, this is because you are using two different
pieces of software: You tell i3 to update focus, i3 confirms that, and then you
ask X11 to give you the current focus. There is a certain time i3 needs to
update the X11 state. If the testcase gets CPU time before X11 processed i3's
requests, the test will fail.

image::i3-sync.png["Diagram of the race condition", title="Diagram of the race condition"]

One way to "solve" this would be to add +sleep 0.5;+ after the +cmd+ call.
After 0.5 seconds it should be safe to assume that focus has been updated,
right?

In practice, this usually works. However, it has several problems:

1. This is obviously not a clean solution, but a workaround. Ugly.
2. On very slow machines, this might not work. Unlikely, but in different
   situations (a delay to wait for i3 to startup) the necessary time is much
   harder to guess, even for fast machines.
3. This *wastes a lot of time*. Usually, your computer is much faster than 0.5s
   to update the status. However, sometimes, it might take 0.4s, so we can’t
   make it +sleep 0.1+.

To illustrate how grave the problem with wasting time actually is: Before
removing all sleeps from the testsuite, a typical run using 4 separate X
servers took around 50 seconds on my machine. After removing all the sleeps,
we achieved times of about 25 seconds. This is very significant and influences
the way you think about tests -- the faster they are, the more likely you are
to check whether everything still works quite often (which you should).

What I am trying to say is: This adds up quickly and makes the test suite less
robust.

The real solution for this problem is a mechanism which I call "the i3 sync
protocol". The idea is to send a request (which does not modify state) via X11
to i3 which will then be answered. Due to the request's position in the event
queue (*after* all previous events), you can be sure that by the time you
receive the reply, all other events have been dealt with by i3 (and, more
importantly, X11).

image::i3-sync-working.png["Diagram of the i3 sync solution", title="Diagram of the i3 sync solution"]

=== Implementation details

The client which wants to sync with i3 initiates the protocol by sending a
ClientMessage to the X11 root window:

.Send ClientMessage
-------------------
# Generate a ClientMessage, see xcb_client_message_t
my $msg = pack "CCSLLLLLLL",
    CLIENT_MESSAGE, # response_type
    32,     # format
    0,      # sequence
    $root,  # destination window
    $x->atom(name => 'I3_SYNC')->id,

    $_sync_window->id,    # data[0]: our own window id
    $myrnd, # data[1]: a random value to identify the request
    0,
    0,
    0;

# Send it to the root window -- since i3 uses the SubstructureRedirect
# event mask, it will get the ClientMessage.
$x->send_event(0, $root, EVENT_MASK_SUBSTRUCTURE_REDIRECT, $msg);
-------------------

i3 will then reply with the same ClientMessage, sent to the window specified in
+data[0]+. In the reply, +data[0]+ and +data[1]+ are exactly the same as in the
request. You should use a random value in +data[1]+ and check that you received
the same one when getting the reply.

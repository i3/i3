# This script tries to exec a pager by trying some known pagers if $PAGER is
# not set.
#
# Distributions/packagers can enhance this script with a
# distribution-specific mechanism to find the preferred pager.

# Hopefully one of these is installed (no flamewars about preference please!):
# We don't use 'more' because it will exit if the file is too short.
# Worst case scenario we'll open the file in your editor.
